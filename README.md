Teach Mycroft to say "I love you"

## About
Have you ever wanted to know what it feels like for a robot to tell you it loves you? Well I have. So I created this skill to teach Mycroft how to show affection. Not quite the movie "Her". But a robot will profess its love for you.

## Examples
* "I love you"
* "Do you love me?"
* "I love you so much"
* "How much do you love me?"
